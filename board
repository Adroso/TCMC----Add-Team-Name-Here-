     <p><b>A Masterclass opportunity with internationally acclaimed pianist Roman Rudnytsky.</b> <br><br>
Roman Rudnytsky, an American concert pianist of Ukrainian background, has been actively performing around the world for many years. He is a graduate of the Juilliard School in New York, where he worked with famed pianist pedagogue Rosina Lhevinne, and later studied in Italy, directed by Beethoven expert Wilhelm Kempff and at the Mozarteum in Salzburg, Austria. Roman’s great passion is education and he is currently “Professor Emeritus” of the Dana School of Music of Youngstown State University in Youngstown, Ohio, USA, a position he has held for 39 years. <br><br> Roman also conducts master classes and workshops for local piano students and teachers during the course of his travels. He has played concerts and conducted master classes in more than 100 countries. Since 1979 he has visited Australia every two years, playing more concerts here than in any other country – approximately 550 at last count!

<div class="event"><h1>Volunteer Singers / Musicians </h1><img style="display:inline; float:right; padding:30px;" src="TCMCImages/bulletin/StJosephs.png" width="333" height="150"  alt=""/><p>Our Parish Priest, Fr Mick Peters, is trying to development and foster a community for our 6 PM Vigil Mass at St Josephs on the Strand. <br><br>
I'm helping by organising an event format, where I invite our members to bring a plate for a buffet and I provide music, or friends who can sing or perform. <br><br>
Now that we are achieving some success, we need more people who can sing or play music. 
I'm open to any kind of singing or performing so long as it is not too controversial. My preference would be for an artist to sing a medley of old time favorites. 
Mass starts at 6pm and finishes about 10 to 7.
