 			 <h1>Aquapella</h1>

<div id="artleft"><p>Aquapella are 50 singers from the  Townsville area bringing you a cappella world music at its very best: inspiring  and uplifting harmonies from around the globe. A South African party song, a  Hungarian love triangle, &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; in French - a sumptuous  variety of different languages, stories, rhythms and moods to entertain and  move you in the wonderful common language of music. Come along and travel the  world by song!</p>
  <p>Choir director Beat Lehmann was born in  Switzerland where he first became involved in choir music by participating in  classical productions like Handel's Messiah, Mozart's Mass in C minor etc. A  study year abroad gave him the opportunity to sing with the Pontardullais Welsh  Male Choir. After completing an M.A. in Social Anthropology he concentrated on  his other passion, dance, directing a Modern Dance Company for several years.  In 1986, Beat migrated to Australia where he completed a Ph.D. in Linguistics  and involved himself in choir music again. For 12 years he conducted AkaBella,  a well-known world music choir from Bellingen, NSW. AkaBella participated in  major festivals like the National Folk Festival in Canberra, the Bellingen  Global Carnival and theWoodford Folk Festival where they featured in the ABC  documentary ÃƒÂ¬Festival on Fire and launched their first CD 'Mosaic'. Beat  moved to Magnetic Island in 2003 and has established a similarly successful  world music choir for the Townsville area. Beat's choirs focus on the rich  musical heritage of cultures around the globe. A South African party song, a  Hungarian love triangle, a Mexican lullaby, a French version of 'The Lion  Sleeps Tonight' to delve into the incredible variety and depth of a cappella  world music and the cultures it represents, is not only fun, but a very  enriching and uplifting experience.</p>
<p>Aquapella won the ABC Choir of the Year  competition for Queensland in 2006.<br>
